To make it work you have to download expo client https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US

1. Clone the repo
  Type:
      npm install
  Wait
  Type:
      expo start
  Scan the qr code from the expo cliet downloaded on the phone

Edit: After oushing the code the in the repo and aws creds with it. Aws suspended the keys I regenerated the keys which cant be published here. You can get the keys. Contact me at me@aaykayy.info
